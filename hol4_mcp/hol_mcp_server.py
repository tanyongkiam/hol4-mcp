    Scope: SMALL probes only — test-drive a small tactic block at a parked
    frontier, fully close a small goal, inspect terms, check rewrites,
    evaluate expressions. NEVER drive a whole proof through hol_send: the
    interactive session and the file form diverge silently (prover-generated
    names, >> vs \\, parens, simp-set order) and the proof gets redone.
    Develop on the FILE — going deep means sub-suspend (>- suspend "X" +
    Resume), then jump with hol_state_at.

    For navigating an existing script file (replaying tactics from theorem
    start to a position), use hol_state_at — it handles file changes,
    checkpoints, and tactic replay automatically. For goal counts/slices use
    hol_goals; for DB searches use hol_search.

    Rejected mechanically: `val gs/fs/rw/simp/e/b/g/it/concl/hyp/dest_thm/
    tag/aconv/drop = ...` (shadows a HOL primitive for the rest of the
    session — bind a prefixed name like `val my_gs = ...` instead).

    Also rejected: creating an interactive goal (g/gf/set_goal/set_goalfrag/
    new_goalstack) — that reconstructs a proof in the scratch session, which
    says nothing about whether the FILE form replays (RULE G/I) and diverges
    silently. Develop on the file: hol_state_at to read the accurate goal,
    Edit to change tactics, hol_check_proof to validate. Short single-goal `e`
    probes on an already-navigated frontier stay allowed; `ef` does not count
    as one — it takes a frag_tactic, so running a tactic through it means
    goalFrag.expand/expandf, which apply to EVERY goal in the fragment.

    Also rejected: `load "..."` / `use "..."` — they change the session's scope
    behind the cursor. Dependencies belong in the file (`Ancestors`/`open`);
    hol_state_at(file=...) loads them.

                       source positions fall within the line range.
        context_after: On PROOF BROKEN, number of source lines after the failure
                      to include in the step plan context (default: 0, off).

                      navigation into a target in a cold/unbuilt theory whose
                      earlier proofs are slow or non-terminating. The target's
                      own tactics still replay, so its live goal is real, but it
                      rests on the skipped statements (NOT a verification).
                      Requires explicit user authorization (RULE K); never on
                      your own initiative. Toggling the mode forces a clean

                      uses the server default (HOL_STATE_AT_TIMEOUT / 300s). On
                      expiry the HOL process is interrupted (recoverable) and a
                      TIMEOUT is returned instead of hanging. Raise it only for a
                      genuinely huge prefix replay; <= 0 disables the bound.

    When a proof is broken, the failing step's text is always shown.
    With context_before/context_after > 0, a "=== Steps around failure ===" section
    shows step plan entries whose source lines fall within the requested range,
    indented by nesting depth.
    Each step's text depends on its kind:
      - expand: the tactic text itself (e.g. strip_tac, simp[], Induct_on `x`)
      - open: the goalFrag function name (open_then1, open_by) — marks start of >- / by
      - mid: the goalFrag function name (then2, then3) — marks additional >- branches
      - close: close_paren — marks end of a >- / by group
    The failing step is marked with "<-- FAILED" in the steps section.

    Diagnostic lines to read, not ignore:
      - "[auto-cheated deps: name (reason); ...]" — prefix theorems that
        failed/timed out at load were replaced by cheat; the state shown
        rests on their STATEMENTS only. Verify them before trusting an OK.
      - "[inside opaque step k (lines A-B): state after sub-step j of n ...]"
        — the position is inside one opaque (parenthesized) step and the
        group receives exactly one goal there, so the step's flat sub-plan
        was replayed to the position: the goals ARE the state at line N.
        Not cached (the next call re-establishes the boundary).
      - "NOTE: target line N is INSIDE step k ..." — same situation but the
        group receives several goals, where a flat replay would diverge from
        the file; the state shown is that step's ENTRY, not the state at
        line N. Split the arm with `>- suspend` to navigate inside.
      - "TIMEOUT: step k (lines A-B) ..." — the failing step's source span;
        split it with `>- suspend` or raise the per-tactic timeout.
      - "TIMEOUT: state_at exceeded ... prefix=Ps, target=Ts" — where the
        overall budget went: prefix is dependency load plus earlier
        theorems, target is this theorem's own tactics. target≈0 with
        "your tactics never ran" is a heavy prefix (build the ancestors);
        otherwise the tactic you just wrote is the suspect.
      - "PROOF BROKEN in opaque step k (lines A-B); ..." — the failure is
        inside one opaque step and its goal is not observable; the line
        carries the sub-suspend recipe. Goals are withheld unless
        show_partial=True, and then they are the step's ENTRY state.
      - "Theorem: X ⚠ depends on cheat" (first line) — the state rests on
        auto-cheated dependencies; "[auto-cheated deps: ...]" below names
        them.
      - "[Loop: N edit→navigate cycles on X broke at the same step k ...]" —
        the same step has failed after N successive edits; stop editing
        blind and sub-suspend the arm as the line says.
      - "Ancestor chain for suspension '...'" — a Resume's label was missing;
        the chain names the first broken ancestor to fix.
      - "unmatched smart quote at line L col C" — likely cause of a parse
        error; fix with the printed command.
      - "[HOL diagnostics during this navigation: ...]" — what HOL said while
        running YOUR tactics. "variables of same name but different types" is
        always an error and is invisible in the goal text, which prints no
        types.
      - "Goals withheld: ..." — replay stopped before the requested position,
        so the live goals are the failure point's. Navigate there, or pass
        show_partial=True.
      - "[Session reloaded: ancestor X rebuilt ...]" — a dependency's built
        artifact changed since the session loaded it; the session was rebuilt
        and the prefix replayed from the new artifacts. Nothing to do.
      - "[Session restarted: workdir A → B ...]" — file= lives in another
        workdir; the session moved there. A's loaded context and open
        suspensions are gone.
      - "[Timing: total=..., replay=..., startup=...]" — startup is HOL
        start plus dependency loads (cold init or reload); replay is this
        theorem's tactics only. A slow call with startup≈total is a heavy
        dependency load (see HOL4_MCP_DEP_LOAD_TIMEOUT / HOLHEAP), not a
        slow proof.

    """Confirm a theorem's proof completes. END-OF-THEOREM ONLY.

    Replays from the theorem's start with the per-theorem timeout, so it costs
    the same as holmake at theorem granularity and localizes nothing: a failure
    inside an opaque `>- (...)` / chained arm is reported as the whole lumped
    step. Call it once, when every chunk has already been stepped through and
    you expect OK — not to "see if it closes", and not to find what broke.

    To DEVELOP or DIAGNOSE instead: hol_state_at reads the live goal, and
    sub-suspending an opaque arm (`>- suspend "X"` + `Resume thm[X]: cheat QED`)
    gives the failure its own navigable body.

    Args:
        theorem: Theorem name to check
        file: Path to .sml file (auto-inits cursor if no cursor exists)
        workdir: Working directory for HOL (used with file)
        trace: If True, include full per-step timing trace
        session: Session name (default: "default")

    Returns: Whether proof completes, failure location, brief goal summary.
             With trace=True, also includes per-step timing and goal counts.

    Status values: OK / FAILED / INCOMPLETE / CHEAT / NO TACTICS, plus
    CANNOT CHECK for a Resume whose suspension goal is unavailable (comes
    with an ancestor-chain diagnosis naming the first broken ancestor).
    "Status: OK ... ⚠ depends on cheat" is followed by
    "[auto-cheated deps: name (reason); ...]" naming WHICH prefix theorems
    were auto-cheated at load and why — the OK rests on their statements
    only. A timeout failure adds "TIMEOUT: step k spans lines A-B" naming
    the span to split with `>- suspend`.
