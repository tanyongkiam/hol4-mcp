(* tactic_prefix.sml - GOALFRAG-based proof navigation

   Every tactic step uses ef() (expand_frag), giving 1:1 mapping between
   TacticParse.linearize fragments and executable steps. FOpen/FFMid/FFClose
   fragments are natively steppable via ef(open/close). No heuristics needed
   — structural boundaries ARE step boundaries.

   SML emits raw fragment data (type + text). Python wraps with
   ef(goalFrag.expand(<text>)) or ef(goalFrag.<text>).
   This avoids text-level rewriting of e() output which breaks on multiline.

   Usage:
     goalfrag_step_plan_json "rpt strip_tac >> simp[] >> fs[]";
     => {"ok":[{"end":9,"type":"expand","text":"rpt strip_tac"}, ...]}

(* merge_by_steps: Post-process step list to merge a Subgoal atom (`P`) and
   its following >- bracket back into a single atomic `P` by tac step.

   WHY: `P` by tac is parsed by HOL4 as a single tactic equivalent to
   `subgoal P >- tac`. When applied via THEN-distribution (\\ / >>) over a
   multi-goal stack, HOL4 runs this tactic atomically per goal: each goal
   independently gets P proven (by tac) and added as a hypothesis. Per goal:
   1 in, 1 out.

   The naive decomposition `expand (sg P), open_then1, expand tac, close_paren`
   does NOT match this semantics. `expand (sg P)` distributes per-goal
   (correctly producing 2N goals: [P_1, cont_1, ..., P_N, cont_N]), but
   `open_then1` is a goalstate-level fragment tactic that always focuses on
   the FIRST top-level goal. So only P_1 gets discharged; P_2..P_N remain
   open as subgoals. Subsequent tactics applied via THEN do not generally
   close those — they were meant to operate on the cont_i, not on the P_i.

   This is exactly the bug that occurs when proofs use the common idiom

       Cases_on `q` \\ ... \\ `tttt = ttt` by tac \\ fs[option_le_max]

   after a multi-goal split. In real HOL4 (Holmake), the proof passes; in
   the MCP's decomposed replay, N-1 sg-subgoals remain unproven and the
   theorem looks INCOMPLETE.

   Fix: detect the [Subgoal `P`, open_then1, expand+, close_paren] sequence
   and merge it into a single atomic step `P by tac` (or `P by (t1 >> t2)`
   for a compound body). The merged step is run via goalFrag.expand and
   distributes correctly per-goal — matching Holmake.

   Bails (no merge) on nested open/mid inside the body — those would need
   full source reconstruction to preserve. The unmerged case keeps the old
   behaviour, which is correct in single-goal contexts (top-level `P` by tac
   without an upstream multi-goal-producing tactic in the same THEN chain). *)
