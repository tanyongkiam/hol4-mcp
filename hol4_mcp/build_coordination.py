"""Coordinate MCP builds' artifacts across server lifetimes.

Holmake locks competing writers, but can skip an existing partial dependency.
Builds are compared per artifact unit — the files one Holmake job writes for a
target (fooTheory.sml/.sig/.dat/.ui/.uo) — so independent theories in one
directory build concurrently. Read/read overlap is safe; a write/read or
write/write overlap on a unit is refused. Locks cover cooperating servers on
the same host/user; undeclared outputs and plain external Holmake processes
remain outside this protocol.

Everything the coordination keeps lives under one per-user host directory
(`storage_root`), never in a project tree: lock files, output records,
detached-job records with their logs, discovery traces.

When a build ends, each of its outputs is judged on its own: a job Holmake's
monitor reported as finished wrote complete files even if a later job failed.
A detached job also leaves a record of itself and, through its wrapper, the
exit status Holmake ends with, so a server started after the one that
launched it can report it, cancel it, and apply its outcome.
