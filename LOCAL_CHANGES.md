# `localfixes` branch

Local-only operating branch — **never push to remote**. Default checkout
for this clone. Each commit is one logical change; the history is `git log`
/ `git show <sha>` (this file does not mirror it). Policy and operating
pointers for the running server: `skills/hol4-proving/notes/reference_hol4_mcp.md`.

## Notes files

- `LOCAL_CHANGES.md` — this file.
- `MCP_BUGS.md` — defect register of the navigation/caching review (all
  fixed, each backed by a `tests/test_repro_*.py` test); `MCP_BUGS_review.md`
  and `MCP_TACTIC_COST_review.md` are its companions.
- `HOL_STATE_AT_RESUME_BUG_NOTES.md` — investigation notes for the Resume
  goal-setup fix; historical reference.
- `HOL_STATE_AT_DEF_EDIT_STALENESS_NOTES.md` — the `Unknown identifier`
  symptom after editing a `Definition` above the checkpoint; the two defects
  actually found are fixed (2026-08-28).
- `PARENS_NAVIGATION_NOTES.md` — navigation inside parens-grouped LT chains:
  the single-goal case is implemented, the multi-goal case stays off (the
  b43c34c trade-off).

## Upstreaming notes

- `91255af` + `9a6771d` — opened as PR #21 to upstream
  `HOL-Theorem-Prover/hol4-mcp`.
- `efb689d` should be obsoleted once mcp PR #2481 or #2493 merges.
- `83e42e2` is upstreamable as observability.
- `e134b5c`, `69ee385` are workflow opinions — discuss before upstreaming.
- `011c5b2` is personal preference for cake-while; do not upstream.
- `714b941` + `b43c34c` — try out locally first; if stable through the
  cake-while cleanup tasks, open as a separate PR. Has a documented
  trade-off (lose mid-arm navigation in parens-grouped LT chains).
- `67b6e2e` is a workflow opinion — discuss before upstreaming.
- The Resume goal-setup fix is a correctness fix (avoids a `Parse.Term`
  re-parse that crashes / silently renames under a clashing parse context).
  Upstreamable — discuss before opening a PR.
