"""Backward navigation when no checkpoint can be restored.

Every per-theorem checkpoint saved in a session becomes part of its Poly/ML
SaveState parent chain, and Poly/ML refuses to save over a parent. A rewind
that restores nothing must therefore restart HOL rather than replay in the
old heap: replaying there keeps later theorems bound and loses every
checkpoint it tries to re-save.
