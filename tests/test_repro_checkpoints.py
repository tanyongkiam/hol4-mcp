"""Failing regression tests for checkpoint invalidation, replay cost, and the
per-theorem load budget.

Each test asserts the CORRECT behaviour and is marked ``xfail(strict=True)``, so
it reports XFAIL today and becomes a hard failure the moment the finding is
fixed (at which point the marker comes off).

Covered findings:

  #9  Checkpoint ``content_hash`` is the hash of the WHOLE file, so an edit
      anywhere invalidates every checkpoint — including those of theorems
      entirely before the change, which ``_invalidate_from_line`` deliberately
      RETAINS.  The two merge branches of the save path
      (``_save_context_checkpoint`` / ``_save_end_of_proof_checkpoint``) update
      the path but not the hash, so a checkpoint re-saved under the current file
      content is judged invalid the moment it is written.

  A-4 (field observation) A theorem with 17 ``Resume`` bodies navigated in 4.2s
      (``hash=match``, ``replayed=0/2``); editing ONE ``Resume`` body forced a
      182s full replay (``pos_before=(idx=0,init,hash=miss)``) even though the
      main proof and the earlier ``Resume`` bodies were untouched.  Same root
      cause as #9, in the shape that costs the most in practice: the whole
      chain prefix is discarded for an edit confined to its last block.

  #14 The documented per-theorem 120s auto-cheat budget (``PER_THEOREM_TIMEOUT``)
      only exists in ``_load_remaining_content``, which nothing calls.  The live
      loader ``_load_context_to_line`` sends each prefix theorem with the
      caller's timeout (300s by default) and treats a TIMEOUT as FATAL, so a
      slow prefix theorem aborts navigation instead of being cheated-and-reported
      at 120s.

  A-5 (field observation) An edit landing in a currently BROKEN suspend/Resume
      chain forces ``_needs_session_reinit``, ``_loaded_to_line = 0`` and
      ``_invalidate_all_checkpoints()``.  That reinit is DELIBERATE (the
      suspension store is append/consume-only and cannot be partially rolled
      back) and is NOT what is tested here.  What is tested: the caller is never
      told that the next navigation now costs a cold replay from dependencies —
      490s in the field, with ``status`` reporting nothing at all.

All of these are pure over parsed file state and the save/load bookkeeping, so
they run against a stubbed session — no HOL process, no wall-clock assertions.
