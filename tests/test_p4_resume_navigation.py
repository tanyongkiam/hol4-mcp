"""P4a: navigation past broken earlier Resume blocks.

Investigation outcome (2026-06): the file-order Resume coupling for
navigation is already handled by the existing auto-cheat — a failing
earlier Resume body is re-sent as `Resume name[label]: cheat`, the
suspension closes canonically, and later content stays reachable. P1c
makes that visible ([auto-cheated deps: ...]), so the planned opt-in
skip_broken_resumes flag had no semantic gap left to fill and was NOT
added.

What WAS broken: a Resume whose label does not exist (typo, or recording
suspend never ran) is processed by HOL as a SILENT no-op — no output, no
error, nothing recorded. These are now detected at load (the pre-load
goal extraction fails) and recorded in _failed_proofs as skipped.
