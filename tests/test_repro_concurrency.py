"""Failing regression tests for the concurrency / lifecycle findings.

Each test asserts the CORRECT behaviour and is marked ``xfail(strict=True)``,
so it reports XFAIL today and becomes a hard failure the moment the bug is
fixed (at which point the marker comes off).

Covered findings (``MCP_BUGS_review.md``):

  #10 A ``_state_at_bounded`` overall-budget abort SIGINTs HOL and returns
      without ever reading the in-flight command's reply.  Recovery is left to
      the next ``send``'s ``_drain_pipe``, which gives up after 10 ms of
      silence, so a reply that lands later is read as the reply to the NEXT
      command -- and every reply after it is off by one for as long as commands
      keep taking longer than the 10 ms drain window.

  #11 Nothing serializes cursor-level navigation.  ``HOLSession.send`` holds a
      lock for the duration of one command, but two ``hol_state_at`` calls on
      the same session interleave between commands, so one navigation's
      ``drop_all()``/``gf`` runs in the middle of the other's replay and the
      goals that come back belong to whichever proof won the race.

Finding #10: how long HOL really takes to answer a SIGINT
=========================================================

The abort is only harmful when HOL's reply to the aborted command arrives
more than ~20 ms after the SIGINT (10 ms sleep inside ``HOLSession.interrupt``
plus the 10 ms ``_drain_pipe`` poll).  Measured against an unmodified HOL,
SIGINT-to-frame-completion is usually well under a millisecond -- 0.07-0.12 ms
for ``metis_tac``, ``simp`` and goalstack loops -- but allocation-heavy work
answers far later: ``EVAL`` on a large list reached 3.25 ms and
``List.tabulate(8000000, numSyntax.term_of_int)`` produced 0.22, 0.36, 12.84,
49.23, 58.40 and 352.04 ms over six runs.  Driving ``_state_at_bounded``
end-to-end against a real HOL with a 3-million-term ``List.tabulate`` mis-read
the next reply in 3 of 6 attempts.

Whether a given abort mis-reads is therefore a coin flip on real workloads.
The tests below pin the unwind time with an SML-level ``handle Interrupt``
delay so the outcome is deterministic; the phenomenon they exercise (the reply
landing hundreds of milliseconds after the SIGINT) is the measured one.

Finding #11: the interleaving
=============================

``repro_conc_navScript.sml`` holds two independent theorems.  With the cursor
parked inside ``conc_beta``, one navigation into ``conc_alpha`` and one into
``conc_beta`` issue alternating commands (traced: ``ABABABAB...``).  Both are
backward navigations, so both begin with ``drop_all(); gf ...``, and the
second one's ``drop_all()`` lands between the first one's ``gf`` and its
``goals_json()``.
