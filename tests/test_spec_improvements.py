"""SPECIFICATION tests for proposed improvements — NOT bug reproductions.

Every test here asserts behaviour that **does not exist yet**. A failure is a
MISSING FEATURE, never a regression: nothing in ``hol4_mcp/`` is broken by the
red marks below, and no test here describes a defect. That is the difference
between this file and its ``test_repro_*.py`` siblings, which pin real bugs.

Each test is ``xfail(strict=True)``, so it reports XFAIL while the feature is
absent and turns into a hard failure the moment the feature lands — at which
point the marker comes off and the test becomes an ordinary regression test.
An XPASS here means the improvement already exists and is off the work list.

Design rule followed throughout: a spec test must not invent an output format.
Assertions are therefore made against structured values the code already
carries where one exists, and elsewhere against *tolerant* matchers (any
wording, any 0-/1-based step numbering, seconds or milliseconds) that any
reasonable implementation satisfies.

Improvements specified (background: ``MCP_TACTIC_COST_review.md`` §2-3):

  1  Per-step timing and attribution on ``hol_state_at``'s failure path.
     ``verify_core`` already does per-step ``Timer`` + ``smlTimeout`` + goal
     counts for ``hol_check_proof``; the replay path
     (``_replay_steps_with_fallback``, ``hol_cursor.py:1837-1870``) has the
     per-step boundaries and throws the timing away, so a failed navigation
     cannot say which step consumed the time.

  2  A soft per-step budget: a step that never returns is interrupted at N
     seconds and REPORTED against its own step, instead of the run reaching
     the global timeout with nothing attributed. The only mechanism that
     catches a genuine loop, which by definition never returns on its own.

  3  A loop / blow-up discriminator: a step that FINISHED with a large elapsed
     time was a blow-up; a step that only ever hits the budget is a candidate
     loop. The report must tell the two apart.

  4  ``asms=N`` (assumption count of the goal a step starts from) in the
     ``[Timing:]`` diagnostic line. INFORMATION, NOT PREDICTION: ``fs``,
     ``gs``, ``gvs``, ``simp`` and ``metis_tac`` can all fail to terminate at
     any assumption count, and no context-size threshold detects a loop.
     Nothing here asserts that a large ``asms`` implies anything at all.

  5  One "bad position" message: every bad-position rejection names the valid
     line range (field logs: the useless variant 26x, the useful one 2x).

  6  Disclosing a pending session reinit before paying for it is already
     specified by ``test_broken_chain_edit_discloses_pending_cold_replay`` in
     ``tests/test_repro_checkpoints.py`` and is deliberately NOT duplicated
     here. See the note at the end of this file.

Improvements 1-3 run against a stubbed session that plays a scripted per-step
cost, so no HOL process is needed; 4 runs against a stubbed cursor; 5 needs
neither (the rejection happens before any send).

    ``steps`` is an ordered list of ``(marker, cost_secs, reply_or_None)``. A

    ``_replay_steps_with_fallback``: a batch send carries every marker and
    accumulates their costs, a step-by-step send carries exactly one.

    Costs are charged against the granted ``timeout`` exactly as
    ``HOLSession.send``'s ``asyncio.wait_for`` would, so a step whose cost
    exceeds its budget yields the same ``TIMEOUT: ...`` text the real session
    returns. Real sleeping is capped at ``sleep_cap`` so a simulated
    never-returning tactic costs the test milliseconds, not minutes — but a
    cost BELOW the cap is slept in full, so a wall-clock measurement taken by
    an implementation observes the scripted duration.
