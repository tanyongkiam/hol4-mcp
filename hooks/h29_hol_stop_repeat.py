"""
H29 -- PreToolUse hook blocking REPEAT mcp__hol4__hol_stop / hol_restart on
the same theory directory (the ritual-stop pattern). Supersedes the retired
advisory-only restart hook (restart only; hol_stop had no coverage): the repeat-key auto-allows the
legitimate cases instead of gating everything behind consent.

A first stop/restart always passes (finished a theory, switching theory
directories, fresh start) with a one-line reminder, and so does any stop once
the cached working file (H25's hol4_file) sits in a different directory --
another theory. Blocked: a second stop/restart within 30 minutes while still
working in the same directory, whichever file inside it is current -- the
signature of using stop/restart inside the edit-check loop. That loop never
needs one: hol_state_at auto-detects file edits and rebuilt ancestors and
moves the session across workdirs itself (MCP server), and every stop forces
a cold prefix reload of the whole theory on the next navigation.

Soft hook: the repeat is blocked once, then an identical retry passes with an
override note and is logged (hook_payload.soft_block). A stop within ten
minutes of a budget TIMEOUT recorded by H6 passes outright (a wedged session
is a real possibility there). The literal phrase `restart ok` anywhere in
the session's user turns pre-grants. Fail-open: unknown working file,
unreadable state, or unreadable transcript never blocks.
