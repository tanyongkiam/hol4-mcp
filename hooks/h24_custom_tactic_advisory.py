H24 -- PreToolUse hook advising on newly-defined tactic abbreviations in
*Script.sml edits.

Never blocks. Reads PreToolUse JSON on stdin. For Edit/Write/MultiEdit on a
file whose path ends in `Script.sml`, compares pre- vs post-edit content and
reports `val`/`fun` bindings whose value is a tactic and which this edit
introduces. Lifting a tactic must be a conscious, justified decision; the
default outcomes are to lift a LEMMA or to leave the duplication.

A binding counts as a tactic when its name ends in `_tac`/`_TAC`, or its
right-hand side opens with a tactic combinator (`>>`, `\\\\`, `>-`, `THEN`,
`THEN1`). Bindings named `_` are ignored. Comments and strings are stripped
first. Diff-aware on binding NAMES, so editing a file that already defines
one is silent.

Library files (*Lib.sml, *Syntax.sml) are out of scope by the path test:
tactic abbreviations are legitimate there.
