H18 -- PreToolUse hook on mcp__hol4__hol_send (and Edit/Write/MultiEdit) that
bans `markerLib.lookup_suspension`.

Rationale: `lookup_suspension` is the WRONG tool for inspecting a suspended
goal. Its type is `(string * thm) option`; in a bare MCP session it returns
NONE (the suspension store is populated by file replay, not by a lone
`hol_send`), which tempts you to GUESS the suspended goal's assumptions
instead of reading them -- a RULE F / RULE D violation that has cost real
session time.

To READ a suspended goal, LOAD it into the proofManager and inspect normally:

    markerLib.set_suspended_goal {suspension_name = "<thm>", label_name = "<label>"};
    val (asl,w) = proofManagerLib.top_goal();
    List.app (fn t => print (term_to_string t ^ "\\n")) asl;   (* the real assumptions *)

The parent Theorem must have been processed up to its QED so the suspension is
in the store (navigate `hol_state_at` to the dispatcher's QED first). In a
script file, just write the body inside `Resume thm[Label]: ... QED` and
navigate with `hol_state_at`.

Block fires on any occurrence of `lookup_suspension` in the hol_send command
(or in Edit/Write/MultiEdit new content). Stateless.
