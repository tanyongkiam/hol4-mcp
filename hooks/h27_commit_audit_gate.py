H27 -- PreToolUse gate that runs the post-discharge audit against a `git commit`
touching `*Script.sml`, and blocks on what it finds.

The skill's audit gates fire "when you feel done" -- self-reported, so nothing
fires when the feeling doesn't arrive. Scaffolded proofs pass `hol_check_proof`
AND `holmake`, so no other signal catches them either. This moves the gate to a
mechanical moment: when proof code leaves your hands.

DIFF-SCOPED. Only what this commit introduces is judged:
  - unchanged inherited composition findings are matched against HEAD;
  - banned tactics, `cheat` and `[local]` helpers count only on ADDED lines.
The proposed bytes come from the index, or the selected tracked worktree files
for -a/--only/--include. This hook never changes the real index.

Checks (skill audit gates 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 + the composition sweep):
  Gate 1  a Resume block added -- name the (a)/(b) justification or inline it
  Gate 2  a theorem left with Resume but no Finalise
  Gate 3  `cheat` added
  Gate 5  banned tactics added
  Gate 6  a `[local]` helper added that is used once
  sweep   proof_sweep.py over each touched theorem

Exceptions require approval of the displayed content-scoped review and finding
class. Audit exceptions and permission to execute Git are separate.

An ambiguous prospective commit is reported as unavailable, not silently
audited against the wrong content. Stage separately and commit the index.
